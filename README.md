# Ring-Counter
8 Bit Ring Counter

This project is designed for the 8 bit ring counter. 
This ring counter if made of 8 D flipflops. 
Number of flip-flops used =  Number of states in a ring counter
A common use of the Shift register is as a ring counter. The shift counter and the ring counter are nearly identical. 
The main difference is that, whereas it is attached to the input of the first flip-flop in the case of the ring counter, it is taken as an output in the shift resister.

The output of the ring counter at all stages are shown below in the simulation image
